 **Weather Effects in Energy Seasonal Adjustment: An Application to France Energy Consumption.** Bruguet, M., Thomas, A., & Le Saout, R. (2025) [*Awarded best student paper by the FAEE*](https://www.faee.fr/fr/51-prix-de-l-aee.html)

*Published in [The Energy Journal](https://doi.org/10.1177/01956574251330845)*  [[working paper](https://mbruguet.github.io/files/ej_bruguet.pdf)]  [[slides](https://mbruguet.github.io/files/faee_bruguet.pdf)] 



>*This paper addresses the challenge of adjusting energy consumption data for weather variations by introducing a novel General Weather Indicator (GWI). The GWI combines multiple weather variables, including temperature, wind, sunlight, rain, and cloudiness, using a novel econometric approach that applies K-means for threshold identification and LASSO for variable selection. Through an empirical analysis of sectoral, electricity and natural gas consumption in France, we demonstrate that the GWI outperforms the standard HDD approach by addressing three main concerns: the lack of statistical
criteria for defining the base temperature, the reliance solely on temperature as the weather variable, and the assumption of a constant base temperature over time and space. Based on these results, we propose an analysis of the sectoral functional form and an estimation of weather elasticities for energy demand in France at both monthly and daily levels.*

# Research in Progress
**When Words Save Watts: Government Communication and Household Electricity Use.** Bruguet, M. (2025)
>*This paper examines whether government communication can shape household electricity demand during an energy crisis. Using a dataset of over 12,000 official state-
ments linked with narrative-specific attention indices and daily residential electricity use in France, the analysis shows that effects depend on both framing and context. Conservation-oriented appeals generate only short-term reductions outside the load reduction periods imposed by the grid operator, while crisis-framed messages, particularly those highlighting supply risks, trigger immediate and measurable cuts in consumption. These responses are concentrated among households on peak/off-peak tariffs, who consume substantially more electricity and face time-differentiated prices, whereas base-tariff households react mainly to prices and temperature. The results underscore that public communication can enhance demand-side flexibility, but primarily when framed around credible scarcity risks and targeted toward consumers with the capacity to shift or reduce usage. Communication should thus be seen as a complement, rather than a substitute, to price signals and operational measures in periods of energy stress.*


**Efficiency versus Flexibility: The Impact of Heat Pumps on Household Electricity Demand in France** Bruguet, M. and Civel, E. (2025)
>*This paper investigates how the electrification of residential heating through heat pumps affects electricity demand efficiency and flexibility in France. Our results show that heat pump households consume substantially less electricity per square meter, reflecting higher thermal efficiency, even when accounting for reversible use in summer. However, this structural efficiency gain comes with a marked reduction in behavioral flexibility. While households with electric resistance heating exhibit strong responses to both winter temperatures and electricity prices, heat pump users show no measurable price responsiveness and only muted sensitivity to cold weather. These findings reveal a fundamental trade-off: heat pumps reduce baseline demand and advance decarbonization objectives, but they undermine the effectiveness of price-based demand-response mechanisms. Policymakers should therefore pair accelerated heat pump deployment with complementary instruments, such as automated load control and tailored time-of-use tariffs to safeguard system flexibility.*

**Electricity Consumption Dynamics in the French Residential Sector: Lessons from the Household Appliance Usage Panel** Bruguet, M. and Mary, A. (2025)
*Residential electricity consumption is at the heart of energy transition issues in France, particularly concerning its potential flexibility in times of supply constraints. However, few studies have sufficiently detailed data to distinguish between end uses at the household level and analyse their evolution in a crisis context. This work aims to address this gap by utilising the Usages Electrodomestiques (ElecDom) panel, which continuously records the electricity consumption of 100 French households, assumed to be representative for the period 2019–2024. The objective is twofold: to characterise the quality and representativeness of the sample, and then to model consumption by use to assess the sensitivity of the various items (heating, domestic hot water, cooling, etc.) during the energy crisis.*
