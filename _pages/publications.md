**Weather Effects in Energy Seasonal Adjustment: An Application to France Energy Consumption** - Marie Bruguet, Arthur Thomas, Ronan Le Saout (2024) *Accepted at The Energy Journal* ; [*Awarded best student paper by the FAEE*](https://www.faee.fr/fr/51-prix-de-l-aee.html) [[working paper](https://mbruguet.github.io/files/ej_bruguet.pdf)] [[slides](https://mbruguet.github.io/files/faee_bruguet.pdf)] 

>*This paper addresses the challenge of adjusting energy consumption data for weather variations by introducing a novel General Weather Indicator (GWI). The GWI combines multiple weather variables, including temperature, wind, sunlight, rain, and cloudiness, using a novel econometric approach that applies K-means for threshold identification and LASSO for variable selection. Through an empirical analysis of sectoral, electricity and natural gas consumption in France, we demonstrate that the GWI outperforms the standard HDD approach by addressing three main concerns: the lack of statistical
criteria for defining the base temperature, the reliance solely on temperature as the weather variable, and the assumption of a constant base temperature over time and space. Based on these results, we propose an analysis of the sectoral functional form and an estimation of weather elasticities for energy demand in France at both monthly and daily levels.*

**Unveiling France’s Energy Conservation Policy : Insights from the 2022-2023 Energy Crisis** - Marie Bruguet
>*The research examines the effectiveness of France’s energy conservation policies during the 2022-2023 energy crisis, focusing on residential electricity consumption. The crisis, triggered by geopolitical disruptions and rising energy prices, led France to implement the Plan de Sobriété Énergétique to reduce energy demand.
The objective of the analysis is to empirically assess the impact of price shocks and political statements on residential electricity consumption, using an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model. The study covers data from 2019 to 2023, incorporating primarily retail prices and political discourse on energy.
The findings reveal that both price increases and political statements triggered immediate behavioral changes, with price shocks contributing to a 6 TWh reduction in consumption. Political messages related to the energy crisis led to an additional 2 TWh decrease, though statements specifically promoting energy conservation had no direct effect. Overall, the total reduction in consumption was 11 TWh, with mild temperatures explaining some of the remaining decrease.
These insights provide a deeper understanding of the short- and long-term effects of non-monetary conservation policies, emphasizing the role of political communication in shaping consumer behavior during energy crises.*
