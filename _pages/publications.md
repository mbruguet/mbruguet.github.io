 **Weather Effects in Energy Seasonal Adjustment: An Application to France Energy Consumption.** Bruguet, M., Thomas, A., & Le Saout, R. (2025) [*Awarded best student paper by the FAEE*](https://www.faee.fr/fr/51-prix-de-l-aee.html)

*Published in [The Energy Journal](https://doi.org/10.1177/01956574251330845)*  [[working paper](https://mbruguet.github.io/files/ej_bruguet.pdf)]  [[slides](https://mbruguet.github.io/files/faee_bruguet.pdf)] 



>*This paper addresses the challenge of adjusting energy consumption data for weather variations by introducing a novel General Weather Indicator (GWI). The GWI combines multiple weather variables, including temperature, wind, sunlight, rain, and cloudiness, using a novel econometric approach that applies K-means for threshold identification and LASSO for variable selection. Through an empirical analysis of sectoral, electricity and natural gas consumption in France, we demonstrate that the GWI outperforms the standard HDD approach by addressing three main concerns: the lack of statistical
criteria for defining the base temperature, the reliance solely on temperature as the weather variable, and the assumption of a constant base temperature over time and space. Based on these results, we propose an analysis of the sectoral functional form and an estimation of weather elasticities for energy demand in France at both monthly and daily levels.*

**When Words Save Watts: Government Communication and Household Electricity Use.** Bruguet, M. (2025)
>*This paper examines whether government communication can shape household electricity demand during an energy crisis. Using a dataset of over 12,000 official state-
ments linked with narrative-specific attention indices and daily residential electricity use in France, the analysis shows that effects depend on both framing and context. Conservation-oriented appeals generate only short-term reductions outside the load reduction periods imposed by the grid operator, while crisis-framed messages, particularly those highlighting supply risks, trigger immediate and measurable cuts in consumption. These responses are concentrated among households on peak/off-peak tariffs, who consume substantially more electricity and face time-differentiated prices, whereas base-tariff households react mainly to prices and temperature. The results underscore that public communication can enhance demand-side flexibility, but primarily when framed around credible scarcity risks and targeted toward consumers with the capacity to shift or reduce usage. Communication should thus be seen as a complement, rather than a substitute, to price signals and operational measures in periods of energy stress.*


**Flexibility in the Electrification Era: The Case of Heat Pump Households in France** Bruguet, M. and Civel, E. (2025)
>*This paper evaluates the implications of heat pump adoption for household electricity demand and system flexibility in France. Using detailed consumption data, we show that households with heat pumps consume less electricity on average and are less sensitive to winter temperatures, reflecting improved thermal efficiency and lower baseline loads. These structural savings support France’s decarbonization objectives, but they also come at the cost of reduced responsiveness to price signals and diminished scope for short-term behavioural interventions. The findings suggest that the large-scale rollout of heat pumps should be paired with complementary instruments, such as automated load control or tailored pricing schemes, to preserve demand-side flexibility and ensure a resilient low-carbon electricity system.*


**Dynamics of Electricity Consumption in the French Residential Sector: Lessons from an End-Use Household Panel** Bruguet, M. and Mary, A. (2025)
>*Residential electricity consumption is at the heart of the energy transition, particularly given its potential for flexibility during periods of supply tension. However, there is a lack of detailed data in existing studies to distinguish end uses at a household level and analyse their evolution in a crisis context. This study attempts to address this issue by exploiting the Panel Usages Electrodomestiques (ElecDom) database, which continuously records the electricity consumption of 100 French households, which are assumed to be representative of the population as a whole between 2019 and 2024.
The study has two objectives: first, to characterise the quality and representativeness of the sample; and second, to model consumption by use in order to assess the sensitivity of various uses (e.g. heating, domestic hot water and cooling) during the energy crisis. The methodological approach combines in-depth descriptive analysis with a regression model that predicts consumption based on general consumption. This model is trained using ElecDom data and then applied to representative data provided by Enedis.*
