**Weather Effects in Energy Seasonal Adjustment: An Application to France Energy Consumption** - Marie Bruguet, Arthur Thomas, Ronan Le Saout (2025) *Accepted at The Energy Journal* ; [*Awarded best student paper by the FAEE*](https://www.faee.fr/fr/51-prix-de-l-aee.html) [[working paper](https://mbruguet.github.io/files/ej_bruguet.pdf)] [[slides](https://mbruguet.github.io/files/faee_bruguet.pdf)] 

>*This paper addresses the challenge of adjusting energy consumption data for weather variations by introducing a novel General Weather Indicator (GWI). The GWI combines multiple weather variables, including temperature, wind, sunlight, rain, and cloudiness, using a novel econometric approach that applies K-means for threshold identification and LASSO for variable selection. Through an empirical analysis of sectoral, electricity and natural gas consumption in France, we demonstrate that the GWI outperforms the standard HDD approach by addressing three main concerns: the lack of statistical
criteria for defining the base temperature, the reliance solely on temperature as the weather variable, and the assumption of a constant base temperature over time and space. Based on these results, we propose an analysis of the sectoral functional form and an estimation of weather elasticities for energy demand in France at both monthly and daily levels.*

**Unveiling France’s Energy Conservation Policy : Insights from the 2022-2023 Energy Crisis** - Marie Bruguet
>*This paper examines the drivers behind the reduction in French residential electricity consumption during the 2022–2023 energy crisis. Using an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model, the analysis quantifies the effects of retail price increases, weather conditions, and governmental communication on household electricity consumption. A key innovation of this study is the construction of time-varying indicators of energy conservation incentives based on government statements, using a semi-supervised text classification approach. This method distinguishes two types of statements: those conveying a narrative about the energy crisis, and those promoting energy conservation at home. The results show that retail price increases account for a 7 TWh reduction in consumption, while government statements about the energy crisis contributed an additional 2 TWh reduction. In contrast, general energy conservation messages had no measurable effect, in line with the existing literature. Mild winter temperatures explain a further 2.4 TWh decline.The analysis also reveals that households with off-peak tariffs were more responsive to both price changes and crisis narratives, with effects persisting over time. In contrast, base tariff households showed limited adjustment. These findings underline the importance of repeated crisis communication and price signals to sustain energy savings and highlight that generic conservation campaigns, when not framed within a crisis context, appear insufficient to change behavior at scale.*
