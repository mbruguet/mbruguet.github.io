**Weather Effects in Energy Seasonal Adjustment: An Application to France Energy Consumption** - Marie Bruguet, Arthur Thomas, Ronan Le Saout (2025) *Accepted at The Energy Journal* ; [*Awarded best student paper by the FAEE*](https://www.faee.fr/fr/51-prix-de-l-aee.html) [[working paper](https://mbruguet.github.io/files/ej_bruguet.pdf)] [[slides](https://mbruguet.github.io/files/faee_bruguet.pdf)] 

>*This paper addresses the challenge of adjusting energy consumption data for weather variations by introducing a novel General Weather Indicator (GWI). The GWI combines multiple weather variables, including temperature, wind, sunlight, rain, and cloudiness, using a novel econometric approach that applies K-means for threshold identification and LASSO for variable selection. Through an empirical analysis of sectoral, electricity and natural gas consumption in France, we demonstrate that the GWI outperforms the standard HDD approach by addressing three main concerns: the lack of statistical
criteria for defining the base temperature, the reliance solely on temperature as the weather variable, and the assumption of a constant base temperature over time and space. Based on these results, we propose an analysis of the sectoral functional form and an estimation of weather elasticities for energy demand in France at both monthly and daily levels.*

**Unveiling France’s Energy Conservation Policy : Insights from the 2022-2023 Energy Crisis** - Marie Bruguet
>*This article provides evidence on the drivers of the decrease in household electricity consumption during the 2022-2023 energy crisis. The crisis, triggered by geopolitical disruptions and rising energy prices, led French policymakers to issue public statements to encourage energy conservation.
The main objective of the analysis is to empirically assess the impact of retail prices and political statements on household electricity consumption using an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model. 
Overall, the study provides a deeper understanding of the short- and long-term effects of monetary and non-monetary conservation incentives and highlights the role of political communication in shaping consumer behaviour during energy crises.
The results show that both price increases and political statements led to immediate changes in behaviour during the winter of 2022-2023. Price shocks contribute to a 6 TWh reduction in consumption while political statements related to the energy crisis led to an additional 2 TWh reduction, although statements specifically promoting energy conservation had no direct effect. Overall, the total reduction in consumption was 11 TWh, with mild temperatures explaining 2.4 TWh of the remaining reduction.*
