I am currently a PhD candidate at [Université Paris-Dauphine](https://dauphine.psl.eu/).
My research focuses on demand-side solutions for the energy transition, with a particular emphasis on energy conservation incentives. I am deeply motivated by the need to reduce energy consumption to lower greenhouse gas emissions. By investigating how public policies for energy conservation perform, my goal is to provide statistical insights and tools that can help policymakers design more effective interventions.
