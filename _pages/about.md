I am a third-year PhD candidate in Economics, working under the supervision of [Dr. Anna Creti](https://cgemp.dauphine.fr/fileadmin/mediatheque/centres/cgemp/CV/CV_2022/CV_Anna_Creti.pdf) and [Dr. Arthur Thomas](https://arthurthomaseconometrics.github.io/). I am affiliated with the [Climate Economics Chair](https://www.chaireeconomieduclimat.org/en/thesis/measuring-and-evaluating-sufficiency-and-efficiency-in-french-residential-energy-consumption-marie-bruguet/), the [Ministry of Ecological Transition – Studies and Statistics Department](https://www.statistiques.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/english-contents), and [Université Paris-Dauphine – LEDa](https://leda.dauphine.fr/).

My research focuses on demand-side solutions for the energy transition, with particular attention to incentives for energy conservation. In my PhD thesis, *"Evaluating sufficiency and efficiency in residential energy consumption"*, I study how policies can encourage households to reduce energy use as a means of cutting greenhouse gas emissions. More broadly, I aim to provide evidence-based insights to support the design of fairer and more effective energy conservation policies.
